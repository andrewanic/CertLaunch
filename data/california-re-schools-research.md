## Schools NOT Included (and why)

- **AYPO Real Estate:** Does NOT offer CA pre-license (only CE for CA)
- **Champions School of Real Estate:** TX-only
- **360training:** CA pre-license offered through VanEd brand (same company)

## Sources

1. Browser snapshots of school websites (primary)
2. web_fetch of VanEd and CE Shop pages
3. HousingWire "7 Best Online Real Estate Schools in California for 2026" (Jan 2026)
4. TheClose "7 Best Online Real Estate Schools in California for 2026" (Feb 2026)
5. ScrapFly JS-rendered scrape for VanEd
6. California DRE website (dre.ca.gov)

## NEEDS_REVIEW Flags

- **Kaplan:** Prices ($399/$749) sourced from HousingWire review, not directly from Kaplan's website (their JS-heavy site didn't render prices via any tool). Need browser verification when stable.
- **AceableAgent vs Kaplan:** Listed separately because they operate as distinct platforms with different pricing. Kaplan acquired Aceable but both brands remain active in CA. Confirm this is the right approach with Andrew.
