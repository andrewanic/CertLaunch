## NOTES

- **AceableAgent** is now **Kaplan** — aceableagent.com redirects to kapre.com. Do not list separately.
- **MLS Campus** — does not appear to offer Texas pre-license courses.
- Texas requires 180 hours (vs ~63 in FL), so prices are significantly higher across the board.
- Most schools offer individual 30-hour courses ($75-$148 each) for students who need specific courses only.
- Proctored exam options (required by some employers) add $150-350 to package costs.
