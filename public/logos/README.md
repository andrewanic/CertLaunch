# CertLaunch Logo Concepts

**Brand Colors:** Deep Blue `#1a365d` · Teal `#38b2ac` · White  
**Tagline:** "Launch Your Career. Skip the Degree."

---

## 1. Rocket Launch (`logo-1-rocket.svg`)
A stylized rocket integrated with the letter "C" shape. The rocket launches upward from within the C, with a gradient body (deep blue → teal), fins, and an exhaust trail. Represents career momentum and upward trajectory.

**Best for:** Hero sections, app icons, marketing materials where energy/movement is key.

## 2. Shield/Badge (`logo-2-shield.svg`)
A classic shield shape in deep blue with a bold teal checkmark inside. Conveys trust, certification, and credibility. A small upward arrow crowns the shield.

**Best for:** Trust-building contexts — course certificates, partner badges, footer logos.

## 3. Graduation Cap Reimagined (`logo-3-cap.svg`)
A graduation cap tilted upward as if launching into the sky, with the tassel trailing behind like rocket exhaust. Motion lines and particles emphasize upward movement. Captures the "skip the degree" ethos — taking the cap and launching it somewhere better.

**Best for:** Marketing campaigns, social media, brand storytelling.

## 4. Abstract Mark (`logo-4-abstract.svg`)
Three ascending blocks of increasing height forming a bar-chart/staircase pattern, topped with a teal arrow. A small accent dot anchors the composition. Clean, geometric, scalable — works at any size.

**Best for:** Favicon, app icon, watermarks, minimal brand applications. Most versatile at small sizes.

## 5. Wordmark (`logo-5-wordmark.svg`)
Bold typography-only logo. "Cert" in deep blue, "Launch" in teal, with the letter "a" in Launch replaced by an upward arrow. A subtle teal underline accents the "Launch" portion.

**Best for:** Header/navbar, email signatures, clean professional contexts where the name needs to stand alone.

## Usage Notes
- All logos include the tagline; remove the `<text>` tagline element for compact uses
- For favicon/icon use, extract just the `<g>` icon group from concepts 1–4
- SVGs are fully scalable — no raster dependencies
- Font stack: Segoe UI → Arial → sans-serif (swap for your brand font as needed)
